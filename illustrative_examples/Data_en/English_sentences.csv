the biggest changes are in the length of time people ill with the disease are now surviving and in the nature of the illnesses themselves.
patients diagnosed more recently are probably surviving an average of longer than two years.
this change has big implications for health planners and for those caring for people with aids.
planning was often difficult or impossible and the need for home care was less.
"slowly growing internal lesions can produce great difficulties in the lung and the gut, causing shortness of breath and other problems."
"surviving longer over a year or two, therefore, we have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed aids patients, often reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumonia, to a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature."

this leaflet tries to answer some of the questions you might have on giving to acet by covenant.
a separate leaflet gives details of that scheme.
is a covenant complicated?
a deed of covenant is a legal document which needs to be correctly drawn up and signed.
there is a simple covenant form attached to this leaflet which is quite sufficient.
"all you have to do is to fill in the details, including your name and address and the amount you wish to give, and sign and date the document in front of a witness."
you will also be asked to sign a certificate of deduction of tax once a year confirming that you are a uk taxpayer.
this is all you need do for the tax benefit of covenant giving to work.
how long does a covenant have to last?
"but it is possible to have a covenant which lasts for a longer period, provided that the period is specified in the deed."
do i need to go to a lawyer?
it does not need a lawyer either to draw up any document or to advise you although you may wish to consult a professional adviser if a particularly large sum is involved or if there are complicated conditions surrounding the gift.
how should i make my payments?
you can pay by cash or by cheque.
if you pay by cash you will normally obtain a receipt as proof of payment.
make sure that the amount of the payment is the net sum mentioned in the deed of covenant or the appropriate proportion of that net sum if you wish to pay by quarterly or monthly instalments.
can i increase my covenant payment?
the simple answer is no.
"the amount of the annual covenant payment is specified in the deed, and this is the sum that is payable each year."
"if you wish to increase your support, you can simply write a cheque for the additional amount you wish to give."
or you can enter into a second deed of covenant committing yourself to make payments under both the existing and new covenants.
"as a further alternative, you can enter into a supplemental deed."
this has the effect of cancelling your existing covenant and in return you commit yourself to making payments under the new covenant.
"can i extend my covenant, if i wish to continue making payments over a longer period?"
again the answer is no.
"the length of the covenant will have been specified in the deed, and it will terminate when the last specified annual payment has been made."
at that stage you can enter into a new covenant.
how much can i covenant?
covenant payments are made out of your income and are not capital payments.
you can spread the payments over as long a period as you like.
what happens if i do not pay uk income tax?
"this can cause problems, since you agree under the terms of the covenant to make payments out of income from which tax has been deducted."
"if you have not paid tax, then you would not be able to sign a certificate of deduction of tax and acet would not be able to reclaim tax on the covenant."
if acet did somehow reclaim tax on the covenant then you would be liable to pay income tax to the inland revenue on the amount of your covenant payment.
you may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the uk.
"if you have dividend or receive bank or building society interest on which tax has been paid, tax will have been deducted at source, and this will enable you to sign a certificate of deduction of tax so that acet can obtain the advantages of covenant giving."
which spouse should enter into the covenant?
"if you do not pay income tax, but your spouse does, you should not enter into a deed of covenant on your own."
either you should ask your spouse to enter into the covenant or you could enter into a joint deed of covenant signed by both you and your spouse.
"in either event your spouse should actually make the covenant payments, not you."
the answer is no.
"thus, the first payment should be on or after the date on which the deed of covenant is signed."
"however, it can be possible for the documents to be signed after you have sent a payment by cheque provided that you arrange for us to hold the cheque and not pay it into the bank until we have received the signed deed of covenant."
what happens if i have difficulty in continuing to make payments?
"if this unlikely situation arises, you should discuss the problem with us."
"although acet, like any charity, does not have the power to release you from the agreement it is likely to be sympathetic."
for instance we can suggest ways of rescheduling the payments over a longer period.
"whatever happens, any tax relief obtained on donations you have already made will not be lost."
"but, unless you are considering a particularly large donation, it is unlikely that you would need to include any complicated form of wording."
gift aid gift aid giving to acet by gift aid this leaflet tries to answer some of the questions you might have on giving to acet through the gift aid scheme.
what is gift aid?
until then an individual could obtain income tax relief for a gift to charity only if the gift was made under a deed of covenant.
how does gift aid work?
the mechanism of gift aid is very simple.
the key to the working of gift aid is a certificate which must be signed by the donor.
"without that certificate, the charity can not obtain the repayment of the basic rate tax and the donor can not get higher rate relief."
"you also need to bear in mind that you may have other payments under existing deeds of covenant or other payments made under gift aid in the same tax year, and you will need to have a taxable income at least equal to the gross amount of all these payment, as well as the gift aid payment being contemplated, otherwise you will have to account to the revenue for some tax."
what are the advantages of gift aid over a deed of covenant?
the intention of a gift aid scheme is to encourage giving without the donor being tied to a particular charity for this length of time.
"with a payment under covenant, the deed of covenant has to be filled in corrected before a payment is made."
but to gain the advantages of the gift aid scheme certain conditions have to be complied with.
what are the conditions to gift aid?
"cash includes cheque payments, bank transfers and credit card payments."
thus it must be made absolutely with no conditions about repayment.
gift aid may not be used by a donor as a means of writing of a debt or loan owed to him by the charity.
the donor must be resident in the united kingdom at the time that the gift is made.
what if i wish to give small amounts regularly over a period?
in this way your gift to acet will qualify for gift aid relief even though the monthly payments would be too small to do so.
care would be needed with the wording used in any such scheme and acet can give you more details about this.
what if i wish to give a sum of capital or a sum in excess of my annual taxable income?
this is quite separate from gift aid and details can be supplied on request.
if acet did somehow reclaim tax on the payment then you would be liable to pay income tax to the inland revenue on the amount of your gift aid payment.
so if you are not a uk taxpayer you are advised not to make a payment under the gift aid scheme but to make a straight payment by cash or cheque.
which spouse should make the gift aid payment?
"if you do not pay income tax but your spouse does, then your spouse should make the gift aid payment."
legacy leaving a legacy to acet why should i make a will?
many people wrongly assume that all they have automatically goes to their loved ones.
"moreover, death is a time of great stress to those you love most."
not to have made a will can only add to that stress.
how do i make a will?
there is nothing complicated about it.
a will is simply a clear statement about how your money and possessions are to be divided when you die.
but do not make one without the advice of a solicitor.
he will help you draw up accurately what you need to say.
"he will help you to observe the legal requirements and to name executors to carry out your instructions, to appoint guardians if necessary and to cancel any previous wills."
he will advise you on the inheritance tax your estate might incur and ways in which this may be reduced.
he will be able to remind you of beneficiaries you might otherwise forget.
who will deal with my estate when i die?
it is most important to appoint at least one executor when you make your will.
it is in fact advisable to name more than one executor in case one of them dies before you.
choose people you know well and trust and with whom you can share the details of your affairs.
a solicitor or accountant can act as an executor if you so wish.
how can i reduce the amount of inheritance tax payable on my estate?
there are exemptions for gifts to spouses and to charity.
"of course, taking account of the value of a house and its contents and personal savings and investments it is not surprising that a great many people have estates that exceed the inheritance tax threshold."
"however, a gift to acet is completely free of inheritance tax, due to the fact that acet is a charity."
money that is otherwise destined for the inland revenue can instead go to acet.
what form of words should i use for a legacy to acet?
whether you need medical or nursing advice or practical support in the home we can help.
if you refer for our service you will be visited by one of the team who will discuss your needs with you.
this means that you can decide on your own care support.
"practical support acet volunteers are available to help whenever you need them, as long as you make arrangements with our volunteer coordinator and give us as much notice as possible."
"this means you can get professional help any time of the day or night, and at weekends."
these enable you to call for help from anywhere in your house or flat.
this can bring security and peace of mind to those who are ill but living on their own.
"we are given some financial support from the government but this doe snot cover all our costs and we therefore depend on gifts from trusts, companies and individuals."
if you would like to help us financially why not ask one of our home care team for details.
meeting your needs acet recognises that people can have needs in many areas.
our trained workers find that some of those we care for want to talk through emotional and spiritual issues.
if appropriate one of our specialist nurses will then arrange to come and see you to discuss your practical needs and see how acet can help.
can i refer to acet even if i am using other services?
"acet works with partners, family, friends and other voluntary and statutory organisations to ensure that people get all the care they need in the way that they need it."
our service is completely confidential and only with your permission do we liaise with others involved in your case.
what do others say?
"telephone janet sutton during office hours if you would like to know more about us, and how we might be able to help you."
"this leaflet explains how acet home care in london would help you, or someone you know."
a christian response to aids care education and training why do we need a christian response to aids?
aids is the biggest health challenge we have had to face this century.
"aids touches areas of sickness, death and personal behaviour."
"it brings out prejudice and fear, and people with the disease are often isolated and rejected."
meanwhile health campaigns have largely failed so far to change behaviour.
the church should be able to respond to these urgent needs more effectively than any other group and provide clear leadership.
the church can give care and compassion to those affected by aids and help prevent infection.
our staff and volunteers are drawn from churches of all denominations.
without their commitment we would not be able to provide such an extensive service.
outside the church the statistics are higher still.
our aim is to reduce the number of new hiv infections by giving young people the facts about aids and by encouraging them to think about their future.
many churches overseas are struggling to meet the aids challenge.
in some countries one third of all adults in towns and cities are already infected.
the effect in the future will be devastating.
we run training programmes in romania and support care and prevention programmes in uganda and tanzania.
what can your church do?
your church can become a partner with acet.
"if we are to continue to meet the rapidly growing needs of those who look to us for care and prevention, we urgently need you to share the challenge with us."
this is why we are asking your church to link with acet in a christian response to aids both at home and overseas.
please convey our gratitude to the volunteers concerned.
robert found peace and assurance before his death and i believe such was achieved partly by the demonstration of the love of jesus shown by you.
your team has been invaluable in providing psychological as well as practical support for these patients which have been grossly lacking through the conventional channels.
i hope that you might be able to continue to help our patients in this manner.
i feel that this is reflected not just in the increased knowledge of the students but also in a change of attitude and a few greater degrees of empathy.
after only three years we are now caring for one in four of those dying with aids in the uk.
"the growing number of men, women and children with aids and the fact that people with the disease now survive longer, have made ever more pressing demands on our home care teams."
in the schools the needs for aids education has never been greater.
to meet the challenge we have strengthened our management team to provide the foundation for further soundly based growth.
"it is now more than ever clear that every section of society needs to be involved in responding to aids, including the churches."
acet is a christian initiative supported by all denominations.
the work they do is an inspiring example of what loving community care is all about.
governmental organisations support us financially.
"so do companies and trusts, and churches and individuals."
we thank them.
aids is here to stay.
every donation does help.
"that help makes all the difference to people sick with aids who want to stay at home, rather than spend time unnecessarily in hospital."
please help!
in the uk the spread of infection has slowed down but the numbers ill and needing care are continuing to rise and this is a reflection of levels of infection some years ago.
home care in the uk the need for a national and international aids charity has never been greater.
"in london, demand for our home care services doubled over the last twelve months."
i expect demand for this service to continue to grow over the coming year.
"complex social problems have to be tackled including homelessness, imprisonment, birth of an infected child and death of one or even both parents."
i am pleased to report further extensions of home care over the last year to meet the growing needs in glasgow and also to cover a greater area of the south coast and the east midlands.
"effective prevention has never been more urgently needed, especially in schools."
every educator has a personal story to tell from working in our home care teams.
school teachers and parents know they need help to make aids real.
in northern ireland our work has been warmly received by both communities and their churches.
"with possibly one in three of adults in some african towns and cities already hiv infected, it is hard to know how to begin to help."
whole communities are being shaken by large numbers of deaths among young adults and young children.
half a million babies have already been born with hiv in africa.
"we are seeking to provide urgent help to churches and christian organisations in their prevention campaigns and care programmes, working closely with tear fund, the world health organisation, unicef and governments."
"as a result of preparatory work, programmes will be starting in the next few months in uganda and tanzania."
children in romania romania has been hit by a major tragedy with hundreds of young children hiv infected through hazardous medical or nursing treatments.
new children are being put at risk every day because many care workers still do not know how to protect people from hiv.
over the last year we have moved therefore from care support to urgent training of romanian people who can then become effective educators.
"in addition, local boroughs and health authorities fund us through grants and service contracts."
"the balance of funding has come from trusts, companies, churches and individuals."
"despite these commitments, the last quarter was a difficult time with the recession and the changes in local government financing both having their effects."
"despite the publicity on transmission of the disease, ignorance was such that they became afraid to even visit me."
"it soon became clear that i could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores, like shopping and housework, when i needed it."
i contacted acet who i knew provided practical care at home.
recently i have experienced near fatal fevers.
every day is an effort.
but without the help of acet and other voluntary organisations i would not have been able to maintain my independence.
"today, each person with aids is surviving on average longer than two years, needing more care than ever before."
over the next twelve months we expect a further increase in those needing our home care service to enable them to live and die at home.
"slowly growing lesions can produce difficulties in the lung and the gut, causing many problems including shortness of breath, and periods of continuous pain."
but it is a pain that many families are having to live with as the number of those dying of aids increases.
"in addition to illness, homelessness is a key issue."
"often entire families including young children need practical home care, continuing if necessary after mum or dad has died."
children with hiv one of the saddest aspects of aids is the plight of children infected with hiv.
"for many families in scotland, homecare plays a big part in alleviating some of the huge problems the face."
two out of five acet clients in scotland are women and therefore we anticipate an increase in the number of children needing care.
practical support in the home means that family members may not have to spend so long in hospital.
"men and women discharged from hospital with nowhere to live, or released from prison back into the community, are having to sleep rough or doss down wherever they can find a willing friend."
"it is hard for those wanting to make a fresh start, maintain good health and stay off drugs."
as a result there is now a large group who are at a similar stage of hiv infection at any one time.
drug use is an emotive issue.
people are still injecting and sharing dirty equipment.
we also educate young people in schools about the dangers of drug use.
ultimately death itself may be seen as a release.
however the process of dying can be marred by guilt and rejection.
"tragically, more are becoming hiv infected, and many of those we care for with aids today were infected as teenagers."
"with many sexually active before their sixteenth birthday and with drug taking on the increase, education needs to start young."
aids is a sensitive area which many schools are unsure how to tackle.
acet is in a unique position to meet the need by carrying a high impact message aimed at changing high risk behaviour.
videos and literature are not enough.
official materials and guidelines do not always find favour with parents and governors.
"our educators present a personal message, each one having had experience of caring for those dying with aids at home."
furthermore our work in uganda and romania adds a wider perspective.
the content of each lesson is agreed beforehand in consultation with teachers so it can be tailored to the priorities and individual needs of the school or class.

there is an urgent need for further prevention work.
practical help is also needed for those who are dying and for orphans left behind.
uganda is a developing country with neither the wealth nor the health service infrastructure to cope with the problem adequately.

"the commission kept under review the human rights situation in afghanistan, romania, el salvador and iran but sent a clear signal that it may terminate special scrutiny of the latter two countries at its next session."
the new law may in fact increase the already serious risk of torture facing political detainees.
suspected torturers are permitted under the new law to continue to interrogate detainees while charges against them are outstanding.
"police officers who have taken statements from detainees will also be exempted from being questioned in court unless they agree to do so, making it difficult for detainees to challenge the validity of any confessions made under torture."

the violence in america is frightening.
"drugs, poverty and the availability of hand guns all play their part."
"unfortunately, increased use of the death penalty appears to be the most popular solution."
"in practice, however, issues such as the colour and social standing of the victim will also play a major part."
"once accused of capital murder, the defendant will almost certainly have a problem finding an attorney."
"also, attorneys may be putting themselves up for huge amounts of emotional strain, knowing that their clients stand to lose more than their liberty."
since almost all those on death row come from impoverished backgrounds they lack the funds to hire their own attorney and will be appointed counsel by the court.

by peter nicholls the government of sri lanka has shown itself to be increasingly sensitive to the outcry over its appalling human rights record over the last decade.
"however, it has yet to take concrete steps to stop atrocities, or bring their perpetrators to justice."
"these dreadful events took place in the south of sri lanka, which is dominated by the majority sinhalese population."
"the repression continues today, albeit on a smaller scale."
there have been some events which give qualified cause for optimism.
the sri lankan government has moved to try to counter the criticisms of its human rights record.
"in november, a presidential task force on human rights was set up, consisting of senior figures close to president premadasa."
"its main function, however, appears to be to present a better image of sri lanka to the outside world."
this commission consists of five senior members of the judiciary and legal profession.
"while there, they also met government officials and discussed possibilities for future access by ai to sri lanka."
"such developments, along with the continuing work of the international committee of the red cross within the country, are welcome in themselves and also give some evidence that the sri lankan government is responsive to criticism from outside the country."
the population in the north and east are now living in terrible conditions.
"with hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes by the conflict, the economy of these areas has been devastated and government forces are laying siege to many parts of the north, often involving inaccurate and indiscriminate bombardments of civilian population centres."

but there was absolutely no news of the men.
"the woman showed her a bundle of tiny packages, secret notes, from some of the disappeared men, smuggled out of their secret jail by one of the guards."
the guard was still in the house.
"his note consisted of a few words, impersonal, noncommittal, on a tiny scrap of paper written with a burned matchstick."
but he was alive.
it seemed that the men pooled their money to help survive.
"perhaps he could tell how he was, or where?"
"one of the group of relatives, an old woman who walked very slowly, also had a letter."
her son was very ill.
she decided to try and visit him.
they had a vague idea where the place was.
it was a very long journey right across the atlas mountains and down to the edge of the desert.
"long before she reached the place, the car was stopped by the military."
turn back!
who told you there was a prison?
a year later a second note was among another smuggled group of notes that arrived for the relatives.
"sadly, the notes referred to money and medicines that had been sent by the family but not received in the prison."
the little notes are coded.
there is little real information.
you have to read between the lines.
"recently, an anonymous note, clearly composed from a dialogue between a prisoner and a sympathetic guard, was smuggled out."
the note describes the walk downstairs to visit the cells.
you use a torch to see anything.
"this first cell is now empty, and a second, and a third."

south africa righting the record confidence is the key.
president de klerk said so in london at the end of april.
"by brian dooley if de klerk can convince the world that south africa has come far enough in improving its record on human rights, sanctions will be lifted and crucial foreign capital will start flowing into the country."
"however, the state president is not as confident as he would like to be."
"to coincide with his latest visit to europe, amnesty released a document outlining the apparent lack of accountability of the security forces."
those who dies last year were held under this provision.
"however, with various groups suggesting police complicity in township violence, many blacks will find little security in a larger police force."

"he was afraid of being sent back to ethiopia, where close family members had been imprisoned and tortured."
unfortunately these are not isolated incidents.
"other cases are known to amnesty international, where asylum seekers travelling without valid travel documents have been prevented by airline personnel, sometimes with the knowledge of immigration officers, from applying for political asylum in this country."
there can be little doubt that such examples represent the tip of an iceberg.
it is thought that the government may soon double this fine.
"when people are fleeing from fear of imprisonment, torture or death, they will use any means available to reach a safe country."
"for many people attempting to escape from state persecution, it is impossible to apply for a passport to the very authorities who are inflicting the persecution."
the need to obtain an entry visa from an embassy often situated far away could be dangerous and could therefore hinder departure.
"instead of introducing procedures which can be relied upon to identify and protect all those at risk of human rights violations in their own country, government has introduced a range of measures which create obstacles in the path of those seeking asylum in the uk."
"as there is no provision in the uk immigration rules for issuing visas to asylum seekers overseas, in an embassy or high commission, there is a contradiction in the requirement of visas for asylum seekers to enter the country."
how did it all begin?
from then on the number grew impressively fast.
there was also concern that groups were growing faster in the uk than in the rest of the world.
"however, in the first few years groups did not appear to consider fundraising a priority."
groups were still being run by a very small section office.
"without using any money, some of the escapees got as far as north wales, yorkshire, and scotland."
"although we may claim that we simply publish an objective report, the inference that exceptional evil existed during the occupation of kuwait will naturally be made by those trying to justify the devastating allied bombardment of iraq, now retrospectively."
"i feel amnesty has to provide a quiet, more balanced overview of a region in order to maintain its impartiality and credibility, and to operate effectively."
"participating as a group delegate and individual member in the vigorous agm at liverpool, i was surprised to see a religious service on the printed agenda, with the order of service available at the official information counter."
but the universal character of amnesty should surely bar the incorporation of any religious observance into its official procedures.

"the pupils got the message, and got writing."
"the thing is, she was arrested for ten years for going to north korea without government permission."
i feel that this sentence is far too harsh.
"yet she was pardoned, because she was an internationally famous actress."
can you see the point i am trying to make?
i hope so.
"i am thirteen years old, and if ten years of my youth were taken over by four plain walls and nothing to do, i know how i would feel."
try and think how you would feel if that happened to you.
"please, i am begging you, let her free."
two questions what is art?
"since art critics have these working assumptions in mind, and it is with their writing we shall be mainly concerned, we need to proceed without being distracted."
is it criticism?
"there is a massive amount of writing about art, only some of which can immediately be identified by a reader as criticism."
"as the following chapters will show, the useful and helpful functions of art criticism will receive preference in the choice of what is quoted or discussed."
is the text or part of the text written so that a reader will benefit in a future encounter with a work of art?
a revealing instance a famous passage of art criticism can be cited as one example entirely beyond dispute.
"we all know the face and hands of the figure, set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea."
perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least.
then comes the peroration.
"the presence that rose thus so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire."
"it is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions."
"set it for a moment beside one of those white greek goddesses of beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed!"
"certainly lady lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea."
"several other headings are equally possible, say aesthetics, english literature or italian history."
the library user who looks for books of art criticism is not necessarily going to have an easy task.
let us picture a girl entering through the impressive doors of the new york public library.
"her interest has been aroused by some new paintings which she has seen in a soho gallery, which a friend has compared unfavourably with the work of lee krasner."
how much of the books about pollock will be biography and how much will be about his art?
"among the magazine articles, which are most likely to be interesting to her?"
"her college library has interesting books, as well as the latest art magazines."
"her course teacher has given her a reading list, and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests."
"happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about michelangelo, and has a route map prepared, including introductory and background books, but also passages from longer scholarly works."
"do art historians write about the past, while art critics write about the present?"
"things are not so simple, as some art historians write well about the present, with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture."
"they are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms, partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms."
no interesting touch or invention of form escaped his eye.
"he was equally at home in the metropolitan museum and the museum of modern art, keen in discerning what was good in the arts of many ages and styles."
"as for working art critics, their newspapers need reviews of every sort of exhibition, whether modern or historical."
"furthermore, artists who are also critics are especially likely to make vivid comments on the methods and techniques of old art."
the guards on the frontiers between art history and art criticism shoot neither intruders nor escapers.
"indeed, there are some who feel that there should be no border, thinking back nostalgically to days when there was only one domain of art."
"in some writing today, too, it is possible to find the words critic and historian being used interchangeably."
"art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian, even though the functions and methods of the two sorts of writer have drawn apart."
fifty years ago they were in closer touch.
"if he were alive today, he would have even more cause for satisfaction."
"some of the main efforts of historians in the first decades of the twentieth century had been directed to putting order into a mass of material, analysing works and documents, and establishing historical data."
german art historians had begun much more systematically on this task than others.
"several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information, which became standard works."
roger fry acknowledged german scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century.
"it is here that the germans have done so much pioneer work, and indeed the whole tendency of their art historical studies has been to regard works of art almost entirely from a chronological point of view, as coefficients of a time sequence, without reference to their aesthetic significance."
"modern art historians strive to analyze, interpret, and evaluate works of art by identifying their materials and techniques, makers, time and place of creation, and meaning or function."
"in all cases it seeks to pronounce value judgements, an exercise shunned by art history."
"art criticism seems more likely to remain in the shadows, out of the spotlight of academic controversy."
"writings on art apart from art criticism and art history, there exist several other types of writing about art."
"another sort of writing about art is what artists themselves have written, either about their own work or about other artists."
"teachers of art are more likely to write books of instruction, and in their efforts to educate their students may make comments about the traditions they admire and from which they hope their students will learn."
one lesson for practical students is to analyse works.
"books on art appreciation will also concern themselves with formal questions, as they have done since the beginning of the century."
"a supplementary approach to school art instruction is to draw attention to the types of subject in art, such as portraiture, narrative, landscape."
this thematic method is combined in many introductory courses with formal analysis which is closer to the way that many artists describe pictures.
"her national gallery choices of pictures were examples of problems posed to artists by colour, and in a video talk she demonstrated how these artistic problems had been solved."
"connections with her own practice as a painter were evident, even though her abstract compositions were very different in subject from the works of her chosen artists, who included veronese and poussin."
her argument was that the subjects of the old master paintings could be disregarded by a painter who wished to find lessons for the present in the artistic practice of the past.
the artist as critic in this case deliberately avoided the historical context of the pictures she was discussing.
"any art critic may take such a position, but a historian almost never."
"even if historians are specifically interested in form, it is likely to be the history of forms, or the development of styles which will have attracted their attention."
"it is in the last hundred years or so that theories have been advanced to justify critical or art historical practice, the creation of such theories being made more urgent in the last fifty years by a struggle to establish and then uphold the status of art history as an academic discipline."
the study of oriental art in the west has fared less well.
"a firm basis for the study of oriental art came more slowly, and as we shall see, some of the differences of approach between east and west still require wider recognition."
"moreover, other cultures, such as those of africa, have had to wait until even more recent times for recognition."
"it is literature within the last three centuries, then, that provides the main choices for a reader."
"the advice offered here is that a reader should ignore what category of writing a book or article may come under, since helpful art criticism may be found in all sorts of sources."
writing of many types may assist a reader who looks forward to an encounter with a work of art.
a rule of thumb it will by now have become evident that this book takes an unorthodox approach to art criticism.
"there will be no attempt to define exactly what art criticism is, or to set out a theory of criticism, beyond the suggestions of some differences in writings on art which have already been made."
nor will a history of art criticism be attempted.
"to put the matter in a slightly different way, reading art criticism is a preparation for an aesthetic event."
"in other words, there are no aesthetic objects, only physical objects, which, when observed, are capable of stimulating an aesthetic event."
her idea of the value of art criticism was a simple one.
in her mind there was a set of events which includes reading about a work of art and looking at it.
there was a crucial sequence.
michelangelo painted the ceiling.
critics have visited the chapel and written about it.
"in her reading about the sistine chapel, we can imagine our friend using a rule of thumb to distinguish what was helpful to her."
"according to this, art criticism has three indispensable elements."
"these are description, interpretation, and judgement."
art criticism at its most helpful does not stint the reader of any one of these elements.
"to be aware of the limitations of different forms of publication is an advantage for the reader, who can by this means avoid unnecessary disappointments."
"description, interpretation and judgement are the subjects of separate chapters, where they are considered in more detail."
"without anticipating this fuller discussion, it is worth making two or three points immediately."
"the evaluation is a summing up which places the work in the experience of the critic, and helps the reader to form a judgement."
"the plan of the book, then, is simple."
"after the first two chapters, it discusses where and how to read art criticism."
"while this first chapter has outlined what that criticism is, the next gives sketches of half a dozen critical types."
"so, it is to the critics themselves we turn next."
"an art critic also needs a gift for persuasion, perhaps rather more than a head for exposition and argument."
"evocative description can be an effective weapon in the armoury of a critic, besides which a light touch of wit or some conversational sparkle do no harm."
"we can start with baudelaire, sometimes considered to be a father of modern criticism."
"the custom of writing about the salons was well established, and had inspired brilliant writing by such an important figure in the eighteenth century as diderot."
"he asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times, careful to avoid hackneyed subjects."
modernity also had other manifestations.
it is an additional pleasure to recognise his prophetic power of divining where the best art was to be found.
"baudelaire argued for modernity, but he also strongly believed that a critic has the right to be partisan."
he asserted the plain fact of the existence of differences in taste.
"but, seeing that a fine picture is nature reflected by an artist, the criticism which i approve will be that picture reflected by an intelligent and sensitive mind."
"the advocate a partial and passionate critic also writing in the middle of the nineteenth century was john ruskin, as devoted to turner as baudelaire was to delacroix."
"he may be taken as an example of a first type of critic, the advocate."
"between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea, dyeing it with an awful but glorious light, the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold, and bathes like blood."
"ruskin wrote fluently and seriously, often at length."
"these sites of criticism are cramping for persuasive advocacy, even if excellent use is sometimes made of them."
"at the beginning of surrealism it was argued that there was no surrealist painting, but this dogma was soon reversed."
"a personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in writing criticism, as he may learn about artistic intentions which are not explained to others."
"this places a critic in a privileged position, but also with a responsibility to make clear whether views expressed are those of the critic or those of the artist."
the progressive a second type of critic may be called the progressive.
"he welcomed the varied responses of artists and writers to modern life, and in his own poetry explored innovations."
he believed that paris was seeing a forward surge in the arts.
writing on were unaffected by french bourgeois taste.
"like apollinaire, they saw a rift between the old century and the new."
more and more the struggle to express it intensified.
"matisse and all the others saw the twentieth century with their eyes but they saw the reality of the nineteenth century, picasso was the only one in painting who saw the twentieth century with his eyes and saw its reality and consequently his struggle was terrifying, terrifying for himself and for the others, because he had nothing to help him, the past did not help him, nor the present, he had to do it all alone and, in spite of much strength he is often very weak, he consoled himself and allowed himself to be seduced by other things which led him more or less astray."
"as a critic, his descriptions of paintings were phrased with exceptional care."
"but at the same time he was both transmitter and receiver, so to speak."
"art now had started life as a lecture series, but read was a frequent reviewer of exhibitions, and a contributor to the listener, from which some short essays were published under the title the meaning of art."
read was a progressive without being wholly partisan.
this was difficult to understand for impassioned artists who saw surrealism and abstraction as struggling for the soul of modern art.
"the politician a committed critic writes from a social, nationalist or political conviction, which interacts with an aesthetic response to a work of art."
national or political fervour can alternatively be the motor force of remarkable artistic achievements.
among some of his frescoes there are some which are imprinted on the memory for ever.
commentary or criticism of such art within the country concerned necessarily takes the same position.
"in modern china an attempt has also been made to create a national art, in this instance by partly discrediting tradition."
"this brief diversion into the cultural and political history of germany, the ussr and china has been made to emphasise the way that a state may determine artistic production, and thence art criticism."
"in other political states during the twentieth century, there has been strong support for the view that art should serve a social purpose."
"he argued against an excessively formalist type of analysis of art, by pointing out how everyday emotions and ideas also affect the viewer of paintings or sculpture."
"many of his readers approved his sensitive and appreciative understanding of paintings, though without sharing his political views."
"the compiler a fourth type of critic can be called the compiler, whose criticism is implied in choices for collections or exhibitions."
"alfred barr, the first director of the museum of modern art, new york, is exemplary."
"these qualities have always been present in the metaphors and similes of poetry but they have been less frequent in painting, which in the past was largely concerned with reproducing external reality, with decoration, or, as in the more advanced movements of recent years, with the composition of color and line into formal design."
"the traditionalist some stress has been thrown thus far on modernism and its advocacy, but a traditional critic may write as well or better than a modernist."
"our fifth type must therefore be the traditionalist, for whom it is a pleasure to find the past living on in the present."
a traditional critic has the advantage of being able to turn to standards and values inherited from the past.
the highest praise can be given to works which match up and accord with these.
"nobody excelled him in that judgement, with which he united his own observations on nature, the energy of michelangelo, and beauty and simplicity of the antique."
"to the question, therefore, which ought to hold the first rank, raphael or michelangelo, it must be answered, that if it is to be given to him who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities of the art than any other man, there is no doubt but raphael is the first."
"reynolds was a notable conversationalist, well able to stand up to his friends, who included samuel johnson and edmund burke."
it is in this more informal context that his draft for a sixteenth and ironical discourse should be read.
the student here may inform himself whether he has been favoured by heaven with this truly divine gift.
"if he finds it necessary to copy, to study the work of other painters, or any way to seek for help out of himself, he may be sure that he has received nothing of that inspiration."
"but his views were dismaying to one of the readers of his discourses, the poet and artist william blake."
"for if it is a deceit, the whole bible is madness."
"today, theory is in high fashion at western universities, and varied in scope."
"literary theory, drawing on other disciplines, including semiotics and linguistics, seeks for underlying structures and meanings in literature."
"the medium of an art critic as theoretician is the magazine or journal article, not necessarily in a publication specialising in art."
"theories are interdisciplinary, and the specific quality of a painting or a sculpture may not be spotlighted by the theoretician, whose writing is likely to be long on interpretation but short on description."
a theoretician is well prepared to consider what the most apt questions about works of art may be.
"there is, after all, a rich plurality of means and intents in a painting."
"but, though independent, these objects of his attention coalesced, inevitably, in the act of painting when all the discrete, scattered moments, followed up, caught on the wing, suspended or elusive, were in process of becoming the picture on the easel."
even such richness may not be enough for a theoretician.
"for him, critical writing has to take up wider issues than enjoyment of a picture or a sculpture."
"or, the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication, such as photography, film or television."
theorists may also be more difficult to follow in their arguments because of a current of polemic with which a reader may not be familiar.
her particular target for attack was the formalist interpretation of abstract art by clement greenberg.
"and, we might ask, what else could conceptual art be?"
"many art books follow this plan, especially those aiming to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation."
"art histories often make an attempt to keep to chronology, although the difficulties include the crucial fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events."
this is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear.
"newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about different aspects of the past, such as social conditions."
deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian.
"in europe, classical times are a beginning for historians, but not for archaeologists."
"in writings about the renaissance, its beginning may be seen to waver from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century."
"his book entitled the civilization of the renaissance in italy avoids a chronological sequence, since his plan of arrangement was to build up a mosaic of characteristic material."
a few single volumes have had deserved success.
she called it art through the ages.
"neither of these works, nor two more which are to be discussed, have attempted to integrate eastern with western art."
he is the first of a long line of distinguished french portrait sculptors.
"an unwary reader might think that the book is a history of the changes in western art, whereas it is in fact only a selection of some changes."
"the story of art highlights change and development, sadly at the expense of art which is less varied, of however high a quality."
"as for a varied painter, only one work is likely to appear in a survey."
excellence is not necessarily a criterion for including a picture or a sculpture in a chronological survey.
"the author may choose to use a characteristic work, something typical of its time and place."
there are also technical limitations.
"again, the need for the deeply interested reader to supplement a survey with other books becomes evident."
"the presenter of a television series has some advantage over a writer, since filming is more flexible than book production."
a demonstration of the point is to compare civilisation by kenneth clark in its forms as television and book.
"the television series is a much richer visual experience, and filming has a completely decisive advantage in being able to explore architecture, inside and out."
"nevertheless, the limitations of writing a script to accompany images on the screen become clear on the printed page."
"a presenter, after all, knows that a viewer has the visual evidence to check on what is being said."
other civilisations are treated in separate studies.
"in our rapidly vanishing century, decades are also taken as periods of time to be commemorated."
"in a dispassionate view, a century seems to have several advantages, as being more than a lifespan and being an evident but arbitrary division."
"art is not alone in failing to conform contentedly to such chronological schemes, indeed, some might say that poetry or music are even less amenable."
"an alternative to dates is to use a term like romantic, even if its meaning seems to alter from writer to writer."
who means today what baudelaire meant?
"attempting to capture the spirit of a period is another planning strategy for a survey, though this philosophical notion of a zeitgeist is notoriously elusive."
it is perhaps more the stuff of epigrams than analysis.
"a further, and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists."
it is intended to be a contribution to the history of style rather than of individual artists.
"this, i confess, is to me the real aim of art history."
these are matters which border on philosophy.
photographs can reduce the scale of a monument or enlarge a detail for scrutiny.
"the answers include history, perhaps technology and sometimes art criticism."
"there is no shortage of guide books in the modern world, nor of travel books which regale readers with accounts of what travellers have seen."
so vivid a response by a great poet must inspire respect and possibly a curiosity to see if the reader can match the experience.
"guide books customarily take a lesser role, informing the traveller and listing things to see."
these functions have been well carried out by baedeker guides since the foundation of the german firm in the first part of the nineteenth century.
a star system in guide books is still common practice today.
"as art criticism, it has the merit of making a judgement, though description and interpretation may be meagre."
"some rankings have more than the approval of the author of a guide, and are attested by other authorities, local or even national."
"in czechoslovakia works of importance are graded as national treasures, and while the japanese have a similar system, they also rank places."
"not every city would be suited to this approach, it must be admitted."
"in rome a visitor can stand in front of a baroque church, but a few minutes later, having walked only a short distance, may have plunged back in time to antiquity."
"this is not true in philadelphia, where a new city decisively overwhelms the old."
"the liberty bell and the court house are attractions which repay attention, but have far less power of historical recall."
"guide books are arranged to suit the convenience of the traveller, for whom routes round a city or a site are often suggested."
"in an art museum, the works may be described from room to room, whether in a book or on a sound guide."
"a sound guide has an edge over the printed page, since the listener is looking at what is being described, interpreted and judged."
"geographical surveys the tourist may find guide books excellent value, but an armchair traveller may be better served in other ways."
"books on any of these topics are likely to have a chronological framework, but the first principle of selection is place."
surveys of art on geographical lines are a commonplace of policy for publishers.
"the art criticism in such books generally has a slant, questioning whether the country or places have had a determining influence on art."
"the city of kyoto, the imperial capital, lies surrounded by hills and is frequently bathed in mists."
"the visibility, lower than that of the drier climate of many parts of china, has caused the artist in japan to be more concerned with the strength of outline than with the subtleties of depth sought for by his chinese neighbour."
the decorative flatness and the higher colour of japanese art also follow as products of the same climatic necessity.
similar passages of critical reflection or speculation can be found in many books.
does the flat landscape of the netherlands impose a special sort of vision on dutch artists?
"consider czech art, which might be said to have existed only since the beginning of the czechoslovak state after the first world war."
"the beauty and achievements of bohemian art can perhaps be called czech only with an effort, but there is no doubt of the attachment of a people to the heritage that they can rightly claim."
"yet prague was always an international city, whose culture was dependent on native and external traditions alike."
"let us walk with a visitor through the city, a veteran of the second world war who values it as one which was almost unscathed from the bombing which devastated so many european cities."
"as he has enjoyed his day, he sleeps soundly without a nightmare about what was specifically czechoslovak in the sights."
the truth is that nationality in art has limited importance.
"for one thing, a government agency may have commercial or political aims in commissioning surveys or anthologies."
"not a new situation, for there are ample historical parallels."
surveys of techniques surveys of technique often include more rewarding art criticism than either chronologically or geographically based books.
the writer is able to measure artists not only against each other but also against standards of technical achievement.
"by the very energy spent in its realisation, his accomplishment is all the more intense in its expression."
the author is the english scholar arthur hind.
"his working life was spent in the british museum, whose print collection was his special care."
"divisions in the book are unusually clear, separate chapters being given to topics such as function, the market, or the historical and political background of the subject."
he makes a particular point of technique.
in the chapter on technique the author describes the process of carving a figure from a wood with particular properties.
"the grand form offered a scale of more or less assimilation to the form hidden in the wood, the surface a scale of textures, on both of which the sculptors played, and they are a source of specific qualities of the genre."
it has the added value of being firmly rooted in a thorough understanding of technique.
"surveys of painting, it has to be admitted, are more fallible in this respect, partly because of the relative simplicity of the means used."
"differences exist between the media of tempera and oil, or oil and acrylic, but they do not have the importance of contrasts in other material processes."
drawings are quite often given survey treatment.
watercolours are also treated in surveys.
"here the writer is likely to be a practitioner, and the approach may defer to the popularity of the medium as a pastime for amateurs."
it is modestly titled about prints.
in it this english master printmaker wrote lucidly and well about the range of possibilities in his profession.
the technical survey is above all a category of book in which the writer will have closely observed the material discussed.
"this observation has direct bearing on questions of authenticity, since a detail may be the way that the true can be separated from the false."
"the portrait is an endlessly interesting example, a theme redolent with social connotations and artistic references."
"this hope for a natural quality in portraits, however, is frequently disappointed, since many sitters are eager to be flattered."
a theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the christian subject of the madonna and child.
"again, much interest attaches to interpretation, as an impassive hierarchical image of the madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure."
"an art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs to be considered as devotional imagery, and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits."
the title will only serve to confirm my impression.
they had none of the socially sterile attitude towards art which we adopt in our own culture.
"instead, they recognised the value of superior workmanship and used its products to honour the gods who were intermediaries between man and the infinite power of the universe."
the list of themes and their varied fortunes is a long one.
"for example, landscape painting had only a gradual success as a theme in european painting."
"i indulge in it now because the audiences who heard them endured, with much patience, extremes of heat and cold."
"i am grateful, and can only show my gratitude by giving them the text to criticise under more agreeable conditions."
"he concentrated on it because he loved it, and he thereby proved once more his extreme simplicity of character."
"for he had revealed one of the eternally popular effects of nature, one which is still quoted by simple people as a standard of visual beauty."
"animals make up a category of painting with an uneven reputation, though the theme is one of obvious importance and interest in sculpture."
"exclusion, though, is rather less general a problem than a low status for some categories of painting."
"academies of art, whether in the west or in the orient, have had lists of priorities in themes of art, in which there are many similarities."
"this sort of listing is worth knowing by a reader, who may occasionally notice that it underlies the degree of attention being paid to a theme by a critic."
the survey with a theory the last type of survey to be considered has a basis in theory.
omissions are most patent perhaps in surveys made with a political bias.
"a recent survey with a viewpoint is by the american art historian, whitney chadwick."
"women, art and society is a synthesis of work that has been progressing for twenty years about women and the visual arts."
but chadwick makes some sensible points about the questions raised by her account which challenge common assumptions about art and society.
"the most difficult theoretical surveys are those which seem to promise to answer difficult questions about art in general, perhaps especially in the modern world."
"as in books on the philosophy of art, or aesthetics, many do not in fact contain any art criticism, in the sense of description, interpretation and judgement of individual works."
"their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts, and putting new points of view."
when works of art are described only those aspects of an image important to the argument are included.
"it is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place, though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics."
"in short, from some books the reader may gain moral or political enlightenment, but will be disappointed of developing a personal taste."
"if our admiration be true, genuine, and progressive we will in the end come to admire the good and cease to admire the bad."
"we will learn by our own experience what is best, and not by following the dogmatism of another."
"but a subtle critic may well save us a great deal of time, pain and trouble in the learning, for he can set us aright at the outset, and by his example rather than by his assertions show us how to avoid admiring that which is unworthy."
"a book on a single painter, for example, is a monograph."
"there is some doubt in a grey area of differences between monographs on the one hand, and catalogues or biographies on the other."
"for convenience, biographies will be included in the present chapter, while catalogues will be treated in the next."
"there is a boom in publishing books about individual artists, especially those who are already well known."
"the potential reader of a monograph on a minor artist may not find a book easily, but there are plenty of publications on leonardo, rembrandt or picasso."
"it might be thought that this was a natural consequence of the popularity of great artists, but in fact the economics of publishing result in some bizarre decisions about art books."
"art books are expensive to produce, especially if they contain colour illustrations."
both these strategies affect choices of subjects for art books.
other publishing houses in other countries will naturally prefer artists who are already internationally well known.
"this aside, when the reader has found a monograph, what will it contain?"
"in either case, the absence of colour gave an incentive to the authors to provide evocative descriptions."
these descriptions were vital to writing about these two artists in whose work colour plays so important a part.
"at the end of the twentieth century, at least some colour illustrations are likely to find places in a monograph."
the reader can thus be aware that a writer may have written round what happens to have been offered.
this may be important in assessing how well a writer illustrates an argument.
"the standards which can be obtained in colour reproductions today are high, but not always attained."
"comparison of illustrations of the same picture in several publications will demonstrate this truism, while the best test of looking at a reproduction in front of the picture itself can be a disheartening experience."
"a lecture audience looking at a slide projection, incidentally, may also suffer from seeing distorted colours, though art museums take some care to sell transparencies of a satisfactory quality."
"considerations of illustrations aside, the reader will be hoping for enlightenment from the text."
it is probable that this will have much to offer.
monographs are a main source of considered art critical writing.
"the author has had time to consider and reflect, so that descriptions, interpretations and evaluations will have been carefully formulated."
"his aim in this was as far as possible to translate changes of tones into changes of colour, feeling that only by this method could the full saturation and pressure of colour be realized."
the change is gradual.
nor is it so regular that we can trust to it altogether to fix the exact date of any given work.
"there are returns to the impasto, but thin painting certainly predominates towards the end of the century."
